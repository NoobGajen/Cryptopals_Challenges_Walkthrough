## Cryptopals Challenges Walkthrough

Welcome to my Cryptopals challenges walkthrough! I'm [Gajendra Mahato](https://gajendramahato.com.np), and this guide will help you tackle the cryptographic challenges on Cryptopals. As a cybersecurity enthusiast student who loves ethical hacking and CTF challenges, I've created this walkthrough to give you a step-by-step approach to each puzzle.

The Cryptopals challenges are great for both beginners and experienced folks who want to improve their cryptography skills. Each challenge introduces new concepts and requires problem-solving to find the solutions.

#### Getting Started

To start with the Cryptopals challenges:

1. Visit [Cryptopals](https://cryptopals.com/) and begin with “Set 1”.
2. Follow the instructions on each challenge page to move on to the next puzzle.

#### About This Walkthrough

In this guide, I'll be using Python to solve each challenge. If you know some basic Python, it will help you follow along and understand my approach to these cryptographic puzzles.

#### Tips for Beginners

* **Learn the Basics:** Make sure you understand basic cryptographic concepts like XOR, base64 encoding, and block ciphers.
* **Read the Docs:** Use `man <command>` to learn more about any tools you use.
* **Write Code:** Try writing the solutions in Python. It's user-friendly and has many helpful libraries.
* **Search Online:** If you get stuck, use search engines to find solutions and explanations.
* **Join the Community:** Participate in forums or discussion groups for extra help and to share strategies.
